However, while already in development, after a certain evaluation of the APIs, the latest version proved to be incompatible with our requirements.

Faced with this, we opted for the most viable solution, which involved using pre-built templates offered by NumveShop, a Bling partner. From this template, I made some specific adjustments through CSS.": "Freelance\nI studied two versions of the Bling API (ERP) as the client aimed to develop a fully customized e-commerce platform, integrating and updating information through the Bling API.
